# Coding Assignment 

The goal of this exercise is to build a **"Purchase Summary"** user interface using React. 

### Key UI Elements
- "Order Pickup Savings" tooltip
- "See Item Details" expander
- "Apply Promo Code" expander

### Instructions
- The user should be able to enter a promo code "DB2019" and on applying it, see a 10% discount reflect in the total purchase price (Use **Redux** to implement this)
- Refrain from using existing React components out there to help building this project
- For pricing data, you can use a hard-coded object/json and read from it
- Build your UI on CodeSandbox and share the URL when ready.
- Reusability of components is a key factor to consider. You'll be evaluated based on code correctness and quality
